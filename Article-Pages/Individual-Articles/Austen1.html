            <p> Hello everyone! </p>
            <p> In this email, I will be sharing my insights from one quote in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.
                I was originally planning on analyzing the entire book, but I thought that have been too much for one email.
                Therefore, I decided to analyze just one quote! </p>
            <p> However, before I do that, I would just like to thank everyone that subscribed to this newsletter.
                It means a lot to me and I promise that I will not disappoint you!
                Also, a special shoutout to the infamous relaxados which are responsible for 50% of the audience (lol).
                Couldn’t have done it without you guys.  </p>
            <p> With that being said, I hope you take something away from my analysis! </p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p> <i> “A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful.” </i> </p>
            </div>
            <p> I am speaking from experience when I say that I am scared of failure.
                Just recently, when I was coding my website, I thought I would never get to publish it because I couldn’t get things to work for the life of me.
                I constantly asked people for help and feedback – sorry @mom, @dad and @lilbro – and I was never satisfied with the way my website was.
                However, after coming across this quote, I felt foolish. I was so scared of failure that I felt like not publishing my website at all.
                I kept asking myself, what if something goes wrong? What if it’s not compatible with certain devices? What if no one likes the design? </p>
            <p>I might have read too deep into it, but I believe that Jane Austen is saying that there doesn’t exist a perfect scheme.
                Perfection doesn’t exist, and if people trying to get to perfection, they would never get anything done in the first place, which is why they would never be successful. </p>
            <p>This is the reason why I published my website, even though it was not perfect. Most people are not successful the first time around.
                People fail, but I believe that failing is better than doing nothing at all.
                In fact, I believe that every time you fail, you are just one step closer to success. </p>
            <p>
                And so, I think I should fail a little more, and you should fail a little more too. Stop trying to be perfect.
                Go ahead and fail, because with every failure you are one step closer to where you want to get.
            </p>
